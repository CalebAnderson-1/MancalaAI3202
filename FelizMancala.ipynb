The main difference between the two algorithms is the number of nodes searched. The AlphaBeta algorithm searches about half the MiniMax nodes for the same result. With a game this simple and short, the benefits are small, but as the depth increases, they will become significant. Additionally, we see roughly the exact win percentages as before because all that changed was the number of nodes searched. Each game state has an optimal move, and both algorithms can find it, but MiniMax has to search all the nodes to find it where AlphaBeta can prune branches that will not yield worthwhile results.\n"
